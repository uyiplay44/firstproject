                             However, within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master 
                             the soft skills required for being a software developer.So far so good, the skills acquired have 
                             given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.

                        <p>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in the real world space. 
                            I had an immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with.
                            The learning was fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. 
                            I got my first gig immediately after the program.
                            Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.
